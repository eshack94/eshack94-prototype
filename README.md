# eshack94-prototype

This is a static, fluid personal website that is a work-in-progress. Uses JavaScript, jQuery, skel, CSS, HTML, and font-awesome. It's hosted in S3 in AWS (using Route53 for DNS/routing/host zone/alias stuff), with plans to evolve into a dynamic site on E2. Purpose and goals of this project:

1) Gain a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of leveraging various AWS technologies to host static and dynamic websites, respectively.

2) In the process of broadening and expanding my web development skills, I wish to create a tangible product in the form of a personal website.

3) ???

4) Profit
